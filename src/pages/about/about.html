              On the 3rd and 4th of July, CryptoSavannah and the Blockchain Association of Uganda will host the Africa Blockchain Conference 2019, whose theme “Africa 4.0” will focus on “Preparing Africa for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.” The 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR), refers to the ongoing technological revolution that is fundamentally altering the way live, work and relate to one another. It comprises a series of technologies including artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, blockchain, drones, robotics and big data to mention but a few. As they pervade every aspect of society, the conference will address what opportunities they present, what threats they pose and what Africa must do to leverage them for its development.

              Although Africa has predominantly been a consumer of previous industrial revolutions, the 4th Industrial Revolution presents unique opportunity. By harnessing Africa’s large educated youth population, and the ubiquity of knowledge as a result of the internet, unlike previous industrial revolutions, Africa can become an active participant and not just a consumer of 4IR

              The 2019 conference and tech expo will gather 3,000 participants comprising industry and policy leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators, investors, youth and academia. We welcome you to join us, as we experience and contribute to shaping the place of Africa in the 4th Industrial Revolution.
